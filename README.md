This notebook illustrates key cross-validation methodologies, including K-Fold, Stratified K-Fold, Leave-One-Out (LOO), and Shuffle-Split techniques

 When to Use Which Method:
- **K-Fold**: Default for balanced datasets  
- **Stratified K-Fold**: Essential for imbalanced classes  
- **Leave-One-Out**: Small datasets (<500 samples)  
- **Shuffle-Split**: Large datasets with randomization needs  
- **Time Series Split**: Sequential data (not shown here)
